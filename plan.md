---

## Technical Debt & Migration Paths

### Current Technical Debt (Accepted for MVP)

1. **No Separate Backend**
   - **Debt:** Using Supabase Edge Functions + direct client calls
   - **Limitation:** Complex business logic harder to organize
   - **Migration Path:** Build NestJS/Express API later, gradually move logic
   - **When:** When edge functions >50 or complex workflows needed

2. **No Dedicated Cache Layer**
   - **Debt:** Using Supabase's built-in caching only
   - **Limitation:** Limited cache control
   - **Migration Path:** Add Upstash Redis when needed
   - **When:** Performance issues or need for queues/sessions

3. **Limited Image Processing**
   - **Debt:** Basic Supabase Storage transformations
   - **Limitation:** Limited format options, basic optimization
   - **Migration Path:** Add Cloudflare Images or Imgix
   - **When:** Image quality complaints or bandwidth costs spike

4. **No Background Jobs**
   - **Debt:** No job queue initially
   - **Limitation:** Long-running tasks must be synchronous
   - **Migration Path:** Add Bull/BullMQ with Redis
   - **When:** Need async email sending, bulk operations

5. **Basic Search**
   - **Debt:** PostgreSQL full-text search only
   - **Limitation:** Limited search features (no typo tolerance, ranking)
   - **Migration Path:** Add Algolia or Meilisearch
   - **When:** Users complain about search quality

6. **Manual Payouts**
   - **Debt:** Admin manually processes payouts
   - **Limitation:** Doesn't scale, slow for organizers
   - **Migration Path:** Integrate Razorpay Route/Transfer APIs
   - **When:** >10 payout requests per week

### Migration Strategy

```
MVP (Month 0-3)
└── Supabase + Next.js + Vercel
    └── Direct DB queries from frontend
    └── Supabase Auth
    └── Edge Functions for critical logic

Growth (Month 3-12)
└── Add custom backend API (NestJS)
    └── Gradually move business logic
    └── Keep Supabase for auth & storage
    └── Add Redis for caching

Scale (Month 12+)
└── Dedicated infrastructure
    └── Kubernetes or managed services
    └── Separate auth service
    └── Microservices (if needed)
```

    - id, user_id (FK), event_id (FK)
    - amount, platform_fee, organizer_amount
    - commission_rate_applied (DECIMAL, snapshot of rate used for this transaction)
    - payment_gateway, payment_id
    - payment_status (enum: pending, completed, refunded, failed)
    - refund_amount (DECIMAL, nullable)
    - refund_reason (TEXT, nullable)
    - refunded_at (TIMESTAMP, nullable)
    - refunded_by (FK to Users, admin who processed refund)
    - created_at, updated_at

13. **Payouts**
    - id, organizer_id (FK to Users)
    - amount, status (enum: requested, approved, processing, completed)
    - requested_at, approved_at, completed_at
    - bank_details (encrypted)

14. **Images**
    - id, uploader_id (FK to Users)
    - event_id (FK, nullable), play_log_id (FK, nullable)
    - url, thumbnail_url
    - tags (JSON), caption
    - uploaded_at

15. **ModerationSettings**
    - id, setting_key (UNIQUE, e.g., 'banned_words', 'allowed_urls')
    - setting_value (JSON, array of strings)
    - description (TEXT)
    - updated_at, updated_by (FK to Users)

**Purpose:** Store configurable moderation rules:
- `banned_words`: Array of profanity and inappropriate terms
- `banned_racial_terms`: Array of racial slurs
- `allowed_url_domains`: Whitelist of allowed domains (e.g., boardgamegeek.com)
- `auto_flag_threshold`: Number of flags before auto-hiding content

## Key Technical Considerations

### 1. Multi-Tenancy Architecture
- Communities are isolated with their own admins, content, and settings
- Shared database with `community_id` foreign keys
- Row-level security (if using Supabase) or application-level permissions

### 2. Payment Flow
```
User → Buys Ticket → Payment Gateway (Razorpay) → Success
  ↓
Platform calculates fee using event's community commission rate
  ↓
Transaction recorded: total_amount, platform_fee, organizer_amount, commission_rate_applied
  ↓
Organizer balance updated

When organizer_balance >= community.min_payout_threshold:
  Organizer → Request Payout → Admin Reviews → Approves → Payment Processed → Completed
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Ticket Price: ₹500
- Community Commission Rate: 5% (0.05) - **DEFAULT**
- Platform Fee: ₹25 (500 × 0.05)
- Organizer Receives: ₹475
- Min Payout Threshold: ₹500 INR - **DEFAULT**

**Commission Rate Changes (Historical Data Handling):**
- When community admin changes commission rate, it only applies to NEW transactions
- The `commission_rate_applied` field in transactions table captures the rate used at time of purchase
- Example scenario:
  - Jan 1: Community rate is 5%, ticket sold for ₹500 → transaction stores 0.05
  - Feb 1: Community changes rate to 10%
  - Feb 5: New ticket sold for ₹500 → transaction stores 0.10
  - Historical reports show accurate fees for each period
  - Organizer payout calculations use actual fees from transactions, not current rate

**Benefits:**
- Accurate historical financial reporting
- No retroactive changes to past earnings
- Audit trail for compliance
- Fair to organizers (locked rates at time of sale)

### 3. Image Storage Strategy
- Images uploaded to object storage (S3/R2)
- Generate thumbnails on upload (multiple sizes)
- Serve via CDN for performance
- Set storage quotas per organizer/community
- Implement lazy loading and WebP format

### 4. Scalability Considerations
- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Pagination for all list views
- Background jobs for email sending, image processing
- CDN for static assets and images

### 5. Security
- JWT tokens with expiration
- HTTPS only
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (ORM parameterized queries)
- XSS protection
- CSRF tokens for forms
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- File upload validation (size, type)
- User-generated content moderation

### 6. Cost Optimization
- Use free tiers where possible (Vercel, Supabase free tier)
- Optimize image storage (compression, WebP)
- Efficient database queries
- CDN caching
- Lazy load images and components

### 7. Payment System Implementation Notes

**When processing a ticket purchase:**
```typescript
// 1. Get event's community to fetch current commission rate
const event = await supabase
  .from('events')
  .select('*, community:communities(*)')
  .eq('id', eventId)
  .single()

// 2. Calculate fees using community's current rate
const ticketPrice = event.ticket_price
const commissionRate = event.community.platform_commission_rate // e.g., 0.05
const platformFee = ticketPrice * commissionRate
const organizerAmount = ticketPrice - platformFee

// 3. Create transaction record with rate snapshot
await supabase.from('transactions').insert({
  user_id: userId,
  event_id: eventId,
  amount: ticketPrice,
  platform_fee: platformFee,
  organizer_amount: organizerAmount,
  commission_rate_applied: commissionRate,  // IMPORTANT: Snapshot current rate
  payment_gateway: 'razorpay',
  payment_id: razorpayPaymentId,
  payment_status: 'completed'
})
```

**When community admin changes commission rate:**
- Update `communities.platform_commission_rate` only
- Do NOT update existing transactions
- Future transactions will automatically use new rate
- Historical reporting queries use `commission_rate_applied` from transactions table

**Payout eligibility check:**
```typescript
// Sum organizer's earnings from all their events
const { data: totalEarnings } = await supabase
  .from('transactions')
  .select('organizer_amount')
  .eq('event_id', 'IN', organizerEventIds)
  .eq('payment_status', 'completed')

const balance = totalEarnings.reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.organizer_amount, 0)

// Check against community's min threshold
const canRequestPayout = balance >= community.min_payout_threshold
```

**Key Principles:**
- Always use `commission_rate_applied` for calculations on existing transactions
- Never recalculate fees based on current community rate for past transactions
- Payout calculations sum actual `organizer_amount` from transactions, not recalculated values
- Rate changes are forward-looking only

### 8. Content Moderation Implementation Notes

**Automated Content Screening (on submit):**
```typescript
async function moderateContent(content: string, contentType: 'event' | 'discussion' | 'comment') {
  const flags: string[] = []

  // 1. URL Detection
  const urlRegex = /(https?:\/\/[^\s]+)/g
  const urls = content.match(urlRegex) || []

  if (urls.length > 0) {
    // Check against allowed domains whitelist
    const { data: allowedDomains } = await supabase
      .from('moderation_settings')
      .select('setting_value')
      .eq('setting_key', 'allowed_url_domains')
      .single()

    const hasDisallowedUrl = urls.some(url => {
      const domain = new URL(url).hostname
      return !allowedDomains.setting_value.includes(domain)
    })

    if (hasDisallowedUrl) flags.push('url_detected')
  }

  // 2. Script/Code Detection
  const dangerousPatterns = [
    /<script[^>]*>.*?<\/script>/gi,
    /javascript:/gi,
    /on\w+\s*=/gi,  // onclick=, onload=, etc.
    /<iframe/gi,
    /eval\(/gi,
  ]

  if (dangerousPatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(content))) {
    flags.push('script_detected')
  }

  // 3. Profanity & Racial Slurs Check
  const { data: bannedWords } = await supabase
    .from('moderation_settings')
    .select('setting_value')
    .eq('setting_key', 'banned_words')
    .single()

  const { data: racialTerms } = await supabase
    .from('moderation_settings')
    .select('setting_value')
    .eq('setting_key', 'banned_racial_terms')
    .single()

  const lowerContent = content.toLowerCase()

  if (bannedWords.setting_value.some(word => lowerContent.includes(word.toLowerCase()))) {
    flags.push('profanity')
  }

  if (racialTerms.setting_value.some(term => lowerContent.includes(term.toLowerCase()))) {
    flags.push('racial_slur')
  }

  // 4. Determine moderation status
  let moderationStatus = 'approved'

  if (flags.includes('script_detected')) {
    // Auto-reject scripts
    moderationStatus = 'rejected'
  } else if (flags.includes('racial_slur') || flags.includes('profanity')) {
    // Auto flag for review
    moderationStatus = 'under_review'
  } else if (flags.includes('url_detected')) {
    // Flag for review but don't auto-hide
    moderationStatus = 'under_review'
  }

  return {
    moderationStatus,
    moderationFlags: flags,
    flaggedAt: flags.length > 0 ? new Date() : null
  }
}
```

**Event Registration Flows:**

```typescript
// FREE EVENT FLOW
async function registerForFreeEvent(eventId, userData) {
  // 1. Collect user data (auto-fill from profile + past registrations)
  const prefillData = {
    name: user.profile.name || userData.name,
    email: user.profile.email || userData.email,
    phone: user.profile.phone || (await getLastUsedPhone(user.id)),
    ...userData.customResponses
  }

  // 2. Create registration record
  const registration = await supabase.from('event_registrations').insert({
    event_id: eventId,
    user_id: user.id,
    name: prefillData.name,
    email: prefillData.email,
    phone: prefillData.phone,
    custom_responses: userData.customResponses,
    ticket_count: 1,
    total_amount: 0,
    payment_status: 'completed',  // No payment needed
    registered_at: new Date()
  })

  // 3. Generate ticket with QR code
  const ticket = await generateTicket(registration)

  // 4. Send confirmation email
  await sendTicketEmail(user.email, ticket)

  // 5. Redirect to confirmation page
  return { success: true, ticketId: ticket.id }
}

// PAID EVENT FLOW
async function registerForPaidEvent(eventId, userData) {
  // 1. Collect user data (same as free event)
  const prefillData = { /* same as above */ }

  // 2. Create pending registration
  const registration = await supabase.from('event_registrations').insert({
    event_id: eventId,
    user_id: user.id,
    name: prefillData.name,
    email: prefillData.email,
    phone: prefillData.phone,
    custom_responses: userData.customResponses,
    ticket_count: 1,
    total_amount: event.ticket_price,
    payment_status: 'pending',
    registered_at: new Date()
  })

  // 3. Create Razorpay order
  const order = await razorpay.orders.create({
    amount: event.ticket_price * 100,  // Razorpay uses paise
    currency: 'INR',
    receipt: `reg_${registration.id}`
  })

  // 4. Redirect to payment page
  return {
    success: true,
    registrationId: registration.id,
    razorpayOrderId: order.id,
    amount: event.ticket_price
  }
}

// PAYMENT COMPLETION CALLBACK
async function handlePaymentSuccess(razorpayPaymentId, registrationId) {
  const registration = await supabase
    .from('event_registrations')
    .select('*, event:events(*, community:communities(*))')
    .eq('id', registrationId)
    .single()

  // 1. Calculate fees
  const commissionRate = registration.event.community.platform_commission_rate
  const platformFee = registration.total_amount * commissionRate
  const organizerAmount = registration.total_amount - platformFee

  // 2. Create transaction record
  const transaction = await supabase.from('transactions').insert({
    user_id: registration.user_id,
    event_id: registration.event_id,
    amount: registration.total_amount,
    platform_fee: platformFee,
    organizer_amount: organizerAmount,
    commission_rate_applied: commissionRate,
    payment_gateway: 'razorpay',
    payment_id: razorpayPaymentId,
    payment_status: 'completed'
  })

  // 3. Update registration status
  await supabase.from('event_registrations').update({
    payment_status: 'completed',
    transaction_id: transaction.id
  }).eq('id', registrationId)

  // 4. Generate ticket
  const ticket = await generateTicket(registration)

  // 5. Send confirmation email with receipt
  await sendTicketEmail(registration.email, ticket, transaction)

  // 6. Redirect to confirmation page
  return { success: true, ticketId: ticket.id }
}
```

**Admin Moderation Dashboard:**
- Query all content with `moderation_status = 'under_review'`
- Display flagged content with moderation_flags highlighted
- Admin actions: Approve, Reject, Add Notes
- On approve: Set `moderation_status = 'approved'`, `reviewed_at = NOW()`, `reviewed_by = admin_id`
- On reject: Set `moderation_status = 'rejected'` or delete content
- Notify content author of decision

**Paid Event Approval Workflow:**
- When organizer creates paid event, set `status = 'pending_approval'`
- Notify admin of new paid event
- Admin reviews event details
- Admin approves: Set `status = 'published'`
- Admin rejects: Set `status = 'draft'`, add rejection reason in admin_notes
- Only published events appear in public listings

## Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### ✅ Technical Decisions (FINALIZED)
- [x] **Architecture:** Start with Supabase + Next.js (no separate backend initially)
- [x] **Monorepo:** Single Next.js repo initially, split later if needed
- [x] **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
- [x] **Payment Gateway:** Razorpay (India-focused, transaction fees only)
- [x] **Image Storage:** Supabase Storage (1GB free) → Cloudflare R2 when scaling
- [x] **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend/DB)
- [x] **Email Service:** Resend (3k emails/month free)
- [x] **Cost Strategy:** Start at ~$1/month, scale to $95/month only when revenue justifies

### ⏳ Technical Decisions (Still Needed)

### Business Logic (Decided)
- [x] **Platform commission & payout threshold:** Configurable per community (stored in communities table)
  - Each community can set their own `platform_commission_rate` (e.g., 5%, 10%)
  - Each community can set their own `min_payout_threshold` (e.g., ₹500, ₹1000)
  - Allows flexibility for different community arrangements
  - Super admin sets defaults for new communities

### Business Logic (Finalized - Additional)
- [x] **Default commission rate:** 5% (0.05) for new communities
- [x] **Default minimum payout threshold:** ₹500 INR
- [x] **Commission rate changes:** Apply to new transactions only
  - Historical data preserved via `commission_rate_applied` field in transactions table
  - When community admin changes commission rate, only future ticket sales use new rate
  - Past transactions remain unchanged (audit trail maintained)

- [x] **Refund Policy:**
  - **No automated refunds** in MVP
  - Manual refund process only:
    1. User reports issue to admin
    2. Admin reviews case
    3. Admin initiates refund via Razorpay payment portal manually
    4. Admin marks transaction as `refunded` in system with refund details
  - Transaction status: `completed`, `refunded`, `failed`
  - Refunded transactions tracked for reporting and organizer earnings adjustments

- [x] **Free vs Paid Events:**
  - **Same registration flow until payment step**
  - **Free Events (ticket_price = 0):**
    - Collect registration form (name, phone, email + custom fields from organizer)
    - Auto-fill some fields from user login data + past registration history
    - Direct to ticket confirmation page (no payment step)
    - Generate ticket with QR code
  - **Paid Events (ticket_price > 0):**
    - Collect registration form (same fields as free events)
    - Redirect to payment page (Razorpay integration)
    - Complete payment
    - On success: Redirect to ticket confirmation page
    - Generate ticket with QR code and payment receipt
  - Both types generate digital tickets with event details

- [x] **Community Approval Process:**
  - **Auto-approved with grace period warning**
  - Upon community creation:
    - Status set to `active` immediately
    - Automated message sent to community admin:
      > "Your community has been created and is in a grace period. Any unwanted activity will result in immediate removal or deactivation. Please ensure your community follows our guidelines."
  - **Paid Events Require Manual Review:**
    - Free events: Published immediately (with grace period warning)
    - Paid events: Status set to `pending_approval`
    - Admin/Sub-admin must review and approve before event goes live
    - Notification sent to admin when new paid event is created
  - Admin can deactivate communities or put events on hold at any time

- [x] **User-Generated Content Moderation:**
  - **Basic automated moderation for events, posts, comments:**
    - **URL Detection:** Flag content containing URLs for review
    - **Script Detection:** Detect and block `<script>`, `javascript:`, `onclick=`, etc.
    - **Swear Words & Racial Slurs:** Dictionary-based detection (configurable list)
    - **Suspicious Activity Triggers:**
      - Multiple URLs in short time
      - Script tags or code snippets
      - Flagged keywords from dictionary
  - **Moderation Workflow:**
    1. Content flagged by automated system
    2. Content status set to `under_review`
    3. Admin notified with flagged content details
    4. Admin can:
       - Approve (publish content)
       - Put in `draft` (hide from public)
       - Delete permanently
       - Add private admin notes/comments
    5. User notified if content is rejected
  - **Admin Tools:**
    - View all flagged content in moderation queue
    - Filter by type (event, post, comment)
    - Add private admin notes on each item
    - Quick approve/reject actions
    - Ban users for repeat violations
  - **Content Fields:**
    - `moderation_status`: `approved`, `pending`, `under_review`, `rejected`
    - `moderation_flags`: JSON array of detected issues (e.g., `["url_detected", "profanity"]`)
    - `admin_notes`: Private notes for admin team
    - `flagged_at`, `reviewed_at`, `reviewed_by`

### Business Logic (Still Needed)
- [ ] Specific swear words & racial slurs dictionary (to be curated)
- [ ] URL whitelist (e.g., allow boardgamegeek.com, official rulebooks)
- [ ] How many flags before user is auto-banned?

### Features
- [ ] Allow organizers to become event organizers automatically or require approval?
- [ ] Should users be able to rate/review events after attending?
- [ ] Real-time notifications or email-only?
- [ ] Social login (Google/Facebook) or email-only?
- [ ] Allow anonymous posting in discussions?
